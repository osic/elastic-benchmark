      "message": "While 400\u0027s are probably unlikely, these should probably be caught and reported rather than ignored. Per the documentation it looks like this would add the new data to the existing index, which would result in multiple runs being stored under this index rather than a single run as intended in this change.",

      "message": "Yes, of course ES is capable of doing that but I chose to go this route. This is actually less code than the query would be and similar if not less than the lookup. This is not a duplication of an index.  I am deleting the index then creating it again with the latest data.  At most this index will only have 1 document in it at a time. Please point me to why you feel it will be duplicated.  Thanks.",
